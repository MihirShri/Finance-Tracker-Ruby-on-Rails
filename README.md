# FINANCE TRACKER app using Ruby on Rails
This is a Finance Tracker web app created using the Ruby on Rails framework for web development and styled using bootstrap. This is an amazing app in which the users can create their profiles and track any stock they want, all they have to do is simply type the ticker symbol of the stock or simply search the name of the stock from the search bar and add to their portfolio. The data is fetched from a stock API which displays the current prices of the stocks. Users can also follow other users and see their profiles and check which stocks they are tracking and add those stocks to their portfolio too!</br>
